(The video was recorder for outdated version but it still allows to see how the app works).

***
sc2buildmaker-Win - is .NET 4.5 C# codebase which I used to implement Starcraft2 economy model simulator. It also contains simple WinForms application which has similar functionality to SC2BuildMaker android app - it allows to create build orders. I also used this app to  generate SC2BuildMaker version config file which contains all required infromation regarding each unit/building/upgrade and build requirements for each item.

SC2.Win.UI - .NET 4.5 C# WinForms application which I used to generate SC2BuildMaker version config files and to test build orders.
